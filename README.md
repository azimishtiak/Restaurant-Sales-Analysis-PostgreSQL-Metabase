# Restaurant-Sales & Order-Analysis-PostgreSQL-Metabase
## Project Description
This project delivers a data-driven dashboard built using Metabase and PostgreSQL, with data hosted in Supabase, to analyze and visualize restaurant sales and order patterns. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights that guide decision-making across key business areas such as:

- Sales performance
- Product performance
- Order trends
- Time Based Insights

The project breaks down what sells, when it sells, and how it contributes to overall business performance through dashboards. It includes visualizations of sales trends over time, item and category-wise contributions, price segment analysis, customer ordering behavior, and more.
